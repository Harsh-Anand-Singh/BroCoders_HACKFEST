# BroCoders_HACKFEST Open Elective Course Recommendor

Problem Statement

THERE ARE OVER 15 DEPARTMENTS IN IIT(ISM) DHANBAD WHICH OFFER NUMEROUS COURSES
AS OPEN ELECTIVES FOR THE STUDENTS. WHILE SELECTING COURSES FOR A SEMESTER, A STUDENT HAS NEARLY 30 TO 40 OPTIONS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE 1 OR 2.
MANY COURSES OFFERED BY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ARE RELATIVELY NEW TO THE STUDENTS. IT BECOMES QUITE A HECTIC JOB TO GO THROUGH THE COURSE STRUCTURE OF EACH COURSE AND SELECT ONE, AND A WRONG CHOICE HERE IMPLIES A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR ACADEMICS.

Solution

A WEB-BASED APPLICATION THAT TAKES INPUT FROM THE STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR PREFERENCES AND THE PAST COURSES COMPLETED BY THEM.
THEN THE USER INPUT IS FED INTO MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
THEN THE USER IS PRESENTED WITH SUITABLE OPTIONS BASED ON HIS PREFERENCES THROUGH A RECOMMENDATION ENGINE THAT USES SKLEARN MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY.
THROUGH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING, THE MODEL GETS ENHANCED SUCH THAT IT CONSIDERS THE FEEDBACK FROM THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN THE COURSE AND IMPROVES THE RECOMMENDATION. IT CONSIDERS THE PREFERENCES OF THE PREVIOUS STUDENTS AND THEN DECIDES HOW THIS CAN IMPACT THE NEW STUDENT.
